# Language-Recognizer

A language recognizer neural network, done as a starter project to learn about neural networks. The program trains the 
neural networks on a small database of java, c, python, and sml files. Then, the user can input a file in one of the four 
languages, and the program will tell what language the code is in. 

I have implemented the program with both the scikit-learn neural networks and my own implementation of a 1 layered neural network

To use, run the trainer.py file in either scikit or handmade to train the neural network

Then run decider.py <file_name> to have the program decide!

Dependencies - numpy, scikit-neuralnetwork. Both can be pip installed!
